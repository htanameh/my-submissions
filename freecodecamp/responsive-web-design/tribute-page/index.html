                    arranged that the two matches be played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell would happen at
                    his home ground. He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus
                    failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was
                    the future captain Virat Kohli.

                    know, something beyond scientific measure. Something that allows him to soar, to roam a territory of
                    sport that, forget us, even those who are gifted enough to play alongside him cannot even fathom.
                    When he goes out to bat, people switch on their television sets and switch off their lives."
